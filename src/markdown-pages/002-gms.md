This section of the website contains specific guidance for people who are
*running* games. It covers how to invite players to a server and how to manage
channels within a server.

All the [guidance for players](/players) is applicable to GMs too, so please
familiarise yourself with that information *first*.

Once you have read through this guide, you will see that setting up a game
online can take a fair amount of time.

We are aware that not all GMs will be familiar with running online games so UK
Freeforms are recommending that we run tech tests (with tech gurus on hand to
help) before games so that the GMs can see how things work in practise.

We also need to know how you want to run your game at least **2 weeks** before
the game so we can get areas set up or talk you through the process and make
sure you have everything you need to run the game.
