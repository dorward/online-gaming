If nobody can hear you then check to see if you are muted. This might be caused
by a physical control on your microphone, by the mute button next to your
profile icon at the bottom of the channels list, or by your operating system's
sound controls.

If you aren't muted, it could be a connection issue. Briefly leave the channel
and then rejoin it.

Finally, check your [audio configuration](/players-configure-av) to check that
you have set the input to the correct microphone and that Discord is picking up
your voice.
