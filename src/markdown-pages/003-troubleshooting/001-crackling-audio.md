If there is a crackle on your audio, if it cuts in and out while you are
speaking, or if it makes you sound like a robot then:

This may be a **physical problem**. If something is rubbing the microphone or
something connected to it (such as its cable), physically prevent that.

This could be a **bandwidth problem**. You may be able to resolve this by reducing
things which are using up bandwidth:

* Pause downloads
* Ask other members of the household not to stream video
* Disable your video in Discord

This might be an issue with Discord **detecting your voice**. Go into the
[configuration](/players-configure-av) and set it to *Push to Talk*.
