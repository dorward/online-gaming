Discord describes itself as *the easiest way to communicate over voice, video,
and text, whether youâ€™re part of a school club, a nightly gaming group, a
worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to hang out*. It
is the software we have chosen to run UK Freeforms games through over the
Internet.

There are several Discord client applications available for different platforms
and they can be largely broken down into three categories.

* Desktop
* Mobile
* Browser

The mobile clients have greater limits on the number of videos they can display
at the same time, and browser based applications are slightly less robust, so we
request that you **use the desktop application** if at all possible. Since the
different clients have slightly different user interfaces, you may find the
instructions here are less useful if you don't use a desktop client.

Versions are available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Start by visiting [the Discord website](https://discord.com/) and clicking the
*Download for (blank)* button near the top. Then run the downloaded installer program.
