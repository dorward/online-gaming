You can type messages into text channels and read their history. If a text
channel has new messages in it then it will be highlighted.

On the UK Freeforms server there is the social area in the bar section that is
for text. You can use this to send comments to [bots](/bots) and chat to other
people in the bar.

To move to another text channel simply click on the channel title in the
sidebar.
