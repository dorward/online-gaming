In Discord parlance, a server is a collection of text and voice chats grouped
together.

UK Freeforms runs multiple Discord servers, including a general community server
and a number set aside for the running of games.

To join a server you need to be invited to it. Typically this will be done by
sending you a link. Click it and you will be prompted to join the server.

If you are invited to a server, please do not share the invite link with
anybody. In order to foster a safe environment we are being cautious about who
we invite.
