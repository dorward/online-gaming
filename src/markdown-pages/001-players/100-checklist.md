Checking off the items on this checklist before *each* game will help ensure you
have a smooth game.

* Make sure you have the latest security updates downloaded for your operating
  system. This is especially important if you are running Windows and haven't
  had your computer switched on since [Patch
  Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday). If you system is
  downloading and installing updates during a game it can have a negative effect
  on performance.
* Read your brief and have a printed copy to hand for referencing during the game.
* Double check your [video and audio settings](/players-configure-av) and spend
  a little time in the bar area chatting to people half an hour or so before the
  game is due to start so that any technical issues get discovered early.
* Change your [nickname and pronouns](/players-identity) to match your
  character's identity.
