Bots are just like regular users of a Discord server except that rather than
having a human at the other end, they just have a piece of software.

We have a number of bots connected to the UK Freeform servers which are designed
to perform some automated tasks. You can trigger them by typing specific
commands into a text channel.

Keep in mind that everyone with access to a channel can see whatever you type
into it, and that bots are unforgiving of typos. Please take care to type your
commands into an appropriate channel and check them for errors before pressing
