We have a number of [roles](/roles) set up that people may use to show how they
wish to be referred to. Clicking on a user's name will bring up a box showing
their roles, including pronoun roles if they have set them.

To set your pronouns, go into a text channel that you can write into (we
recommend XXXXXX) and type: `!pronoun they/them`.

<kbd>!</kbd><kbd>p</kbd><kbd>r</kbd><kbd>o</kbd><kbd>n</kbd><kbd>u</kbd><kbd>u</kbd><kbd>n</kbd><kbd class="space">&nbsp;</kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>h</kbd><kbd>e</kbd><kbd>y</kbd><kbd>/</kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>h</kbd><kbd>e</kbd><kbd>m</kbd>

Replace `they/them` with the pronouns of your choice. Currently supported pronoun sets are:

* any/any
* he/him
* none/none
* she/her
* they/them

Please contact an administrator if you would like to request additional options.

You can use `!unpronoun` to remove your pronoun role.
