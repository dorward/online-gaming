Sometimes we need to generate a random result during a game and you can use a
bot to do this.

The bot we use is called Sidekick and has support for a wide variety of [dice
rolls](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick#using-it). For the most part, a
simple roll of a die is sufficient. To get this, type `/r d6`.

<kbd>/</kbd><kbd>r</kbd><kbd class="space">&nbsp;</kbd><kbd>d</kbd><kbd>6</kbd>

The bot will reply with the result showing each individual die and the total:

> @Your Name: `d6` = (2) = 2
