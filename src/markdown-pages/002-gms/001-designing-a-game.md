Game design for online play is very similar to traditional freeform game design,
but has some limitations you should account for.

If you are writing a new game or adapting an existing one, consider the length.
Online gaming seems to suit slightly shorter games (2-3 hours of game time) due
to the time in front of the screen.

You should also account for the issues described in the rest of this section.
