Many traditional freeform games make use of item cards. If you need to track
such things in your game then you will need to organise a system to do it.

One option is the use of a shared Google Document that lists all the items in
each location. Players can move items between locations and their character
sheets by copy/pasting. This would mean that the contents of every location
would be visible to all players (as would the contents of their pockets if you
make what characters public in the same way) so players would have to keep in
and out of character knowledge separate.

You might instead use the announcements channel to notify people of the location
of items, which means fewer windows for players to juggle.
