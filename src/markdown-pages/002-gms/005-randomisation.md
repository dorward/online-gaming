Face to face, we will often use Rock, Paper, Scissors as a randomisation
mechanic when characters are attempting something with a chance of failure â€” in
particular when characters are engaged in opposed actions.

You may wish to continue to use that approach and depend on players' video
streams being sufficient to show the result.

It is probably easier to use a [dice bot](/bots-dice) instead.

Make sure you brief players on the method you use.
