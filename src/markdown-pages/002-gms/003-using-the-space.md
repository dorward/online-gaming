Once you have decided where you are going to run you will need to consider how
you are going to use the space.

## Zoom

You will need to work out how to handle players wanting to have private
discussions which the platform does not support. You may decide that typing in
chat is counted as private and players use the honour system and ignore messages
their characters are not privy to).

You also need to handle people talking over each other. Approaches you may adopt
include a clear briefing on etiquette before hand with reminders during the
game. You might also use the ability of the host to mute players who fail to
take a hint.

## Discord

### Game Areas

Since you can set up multiple video/voice and text channels, you need to decide
which spaces you want your players to be able to spread themselves around in and
how they will be named.

We believe that you always need the game areas:

* OOC tech help
* I need a GM
* Announcements

Other channels will depend on the specific needs of your game.

For example Ray has written the 7â€“9 player game *Campfire and Queen* and decided
that it needs three other areas:

* Around the campfire
* The food tent
* The forest

### GMs

You also need to decide on how many GMs you will need and who you will ask to
take on those roles.

Ray has decided that *Campfire and Queen* only needs 2 GMs (herself and one
other) as it is quite small.
